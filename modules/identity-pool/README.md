# identity-pool (placeholder)

Reserved for future use: AWS Cognito Identity Pool (Federated Identity) and associated IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated access.

Use the [user-pool](../user-pool) module for the Cognito User Pool. This module will be implemented when identity pool support is added.
